# Ocean-Alliance
JumboCode 2019-2020 project for Ocean Alliance, led by Danielle Lan.

# Environment setup
We will use Electron for this project, which is built upon Node.js.

If you are on Windows and love working in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you should just develop in Windows; trust me, I've tried to make it work.

If you need a editor recommendation, VS Code is what I (Danielle) am using, and it works fairly well with JavaScript.

Go through the [environment setup page for Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/development-environment). 

Install the packages used in this boilerplate (including Electron) by doing `npm isntall`. This downloads all packages listed in `package.json`.
Currently this includes:
1. Electron
2. Bootstrap
3. jQuery
4. Popper.js (a Bootstrap dependency)
These are just some nice libraries I've been using when doing websites stuff. If you have preferred libraries that you want, we can talk about it; I'm a bit OOTL on what js frameworks that the cool kids are using these days.


This boilerplate code implements everything from the [Electron getting started tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app). To run it, do `npm start`.
