# Ocean-Alliance
JumboCode 2019-2020 project for Ocean Alliance, led by Danielle Lan.

# Environment setup
We will use Electron for this project, which is built upon Node.js.

If you are on Windows and love working in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you should just develop in Windows; trust me, I've tried to make it work to no avail.

If you need a editor recommendation, VS Code is what I (Danielle) am using, and it works fairly well with JavaScript.

Go through the [environment setup page for Electron](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/development-environment). 

Finally [go through the Electron getting started tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app). You don't have to write any code. This boilerplate implements everything in that first tutorial.
