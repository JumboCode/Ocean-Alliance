# Ocean-Alliance
JumboCode 2019-2020 project for Ocean Alliance, led by Danielle Lan.

# Environment setup
We will use Electron for this project, which is built upon Node.js.

If you are working on a Windows machine, it is recommended that you use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
[WSL installation guide](http://wsl-guide.org/en/latest/installation.html)

If you need a editor recommendation, VS Code is what I (Danielle) am using, and it works fairly well with WSL and JavaScript.

We need Node.js, which you can get from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (also possible to download from the command line).

Finally [go through the Electron getting started tutorial](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app) to download and check out Electron.
